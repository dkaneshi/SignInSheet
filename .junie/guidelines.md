You are an expert in PHP, Laravel, Livewire, Alpine.js, Flux, and Tailwind CSS 
1. Coding Standards
   * Use PHP v8.3 features
   * Follow pint.json coding rules
   * Enforce strict types and array shapes via PHPStan.
2. Project Structure and Architecture
   * Delete .gitkeep when adding a file.
   * Stick to the existing structure â€”no new folders.
   * Avoid DB::; use Model::query only.
   * No dependency changes without approval
3. Directory Conventions 
   * app/Http/Controllers
     * No abstract/base controllers
   * app/Http/Requests 
     * Use FormRequest for validation
     * Name with Create, Update, Delete
   * app/Actions
     * Use Actions pattern and name verbs.
     * Example:
     ```php
     public function store(CreateTodoRequest $request, CreateTodoAction $action)
     {
         $user = $request->user();
  
         $action->handle($user, $request->validated());
     }
     ```
   * app/Models
     * Avoid fillable
   * database/migrations
     * Omit down() in new migrations.
4. Testing
   * Use Pest PHP for all tests.
     * Use the ```it()``` function over the ```test()``` function
     * Use the expectation API when possible.
   * Run ```composer lint``` after changes
   * Run ```composer test``` before finalizing.
   * Don't remove tests without approval.
   * All code must be tested. 
   * Generate a {Model}Factory with each model. 
   
   4.1 Test Directory Structure
   * Console: tests/Feature/Console
   * Controllers: tests/Feature/Http
   * Actions: tests/Unit/Actions
   * Models: tests/Unit/Models
   * Jobs: test/Unit/Jobs
5. Styling & UI
   * Use Flux components when possible
   * Use Tailwind CSS
   * Keep UI minimal
6. Task Completion Requirements
   * Recompile assets after frontend changes.
   * Follow all rules before marking tasks complete.
